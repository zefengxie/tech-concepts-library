# REST API (Backend)

## 1. Formal Definition
A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
It uses standard HTTP methods to operate on resources identified by URLs.

In simple terms:
> A REST API exposes data and functionality as resources that clients interact with using HTTP.

---

## 2. Why It Matters for Backend Development
REST is one of the most widely used backend API styles because it:
- Scales well over HTTP
- Is stateless and cache-friendly
- Works across platforms and languages
- Is easy to understand and debug

REST APIs are commonly used for:
- Web and mobile backends
- Microservices communication
- Public and partner APIs

---

## 3. Core REST Principles
Key REST constraints include:

- **Client–Server**: separation of concerns
- **Stateless**: each request contains all necessary context
- **Uniform Interface**: consistent resource representation
- **Cacheable**: responses can be cached
- **Layered System**: intermediaries (proxies, gateways) allowed

Violating these constraints usually leads to brittle APIs.

---

## 4. Resources and Endpoints
In REST, everything is modeled as a **resource**.

Example resources:
- `/users`
- `/users/{id}`
- `/orders`
- `/orders/{id}`

Endpoints should represent **nouns**, not actions.

✅ Good:
```
GET /users/123
POST /orders
```

❌ Bad:
```
GET /getUser
POST /createOrder
```

---

## 5. HTTP Methods and Semantics

| Method | Meaning | Example |
|------|--------|--------|
| GET | Read | Get a user |
| POST | Create | Create new order |
| PUT | Replace | Update entire resource |
| PATCH | Partial update | Update one field |
| DELETE | Remove | Delete resource |

Using incorrect HTTP methods breaks REST semantics.

---

## 6. Good Example: RESTful Endpoint

```js
app.get("/users/:id", async (req, res) => {
  const user = await getUserById(req.params.id);
  res.status(200).json(user);
});
```

Why this is good:
- Resource-oriented
- Uses GET correctly
- Clear URL structure
- Returns proper status codes

---

## 7. Bad Example: Anti-REST Design

```js
app.post("/getUserById", async (req, res) => {
  const user = await getUser(req.body.id);
  res.send(user);
});
```

Problems:
- Action-based naming
- Misuses POST
- Harder to cache
- Less predictable for clients

---

## 8. Status Codes and Error Handling
REST APIs rely heavily on HTTP status codes:

- `200 OK`
- `201 Created`
- `400 Bad Request`
- `401 Unauthorized`
- `403 Forbidden`
- `404 Not Found`
- `500 Internal Server Error`

Status codes are part of the API contract and must be used consistently.

---

## 9. Versioning Strategies
Common REST versioning approaches:

- URL versioning: `/api/v1/users`
- Header versioning: `Accept: application/vnd.api+json`
- Query params: `?version=1` (least recommended)

Versioning is important for backward compatibility.

## 11. Answer Template for Interviews

> “REST is an architectural style that models backend functionality as resources accessed via HTTP.
> It emphasizes statelessness, uniform interfaces, and standard HTTP semantics.
> A well-designed REST API is predictable, scalable, and easy to consume across platforms.”
